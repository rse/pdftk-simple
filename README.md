About
-----

This is a small JavaScript library for use in Node.js
environments, providing the possibility to run the Java-based
[PDFTk](https://gitlab.com/pdftk-java/pdftk) tool from within a
JavaScript API.

NOTICE
------

The PDFTk is written in [Java](https://java.com/)
and hence this Node.js modules requires an installed `java`
executable in the environment.

Installation
------------

```shell
$ npm install pdftk-simple
```

Usage
-----

```js
(async () => {
    const PDFTk = require("pdftk")
    const pdftk = new PDFTk()
    await pdftk.exec("multibackground", "foo.pdf", "bar.pdf")
})().catch((err) => {
    console.log(`ERROR: ${err}`)
})
```

Motivation
----------

The major differences of [pdftk-simple](http://npmjs.com/pdftk-simple)
to similar NPM modules and the motivation for the existence of
[pdftk-simple](http://npmjs.com/pdftk-simple) is that, in contrast to
other approaches, it does not need a pre-installed PDFTk. Instead, it
automatically downloads and locally installs the PDFTk distribution on
`npm install` and uses the plain java(1) command to execute it.

Latest pre-build PDFTk distributions can always be found under the
[PDFTk CI/CD Jobs](https://gitlab.com/pdftk-java/pdftk/-/jobs). You can
download a newer `pdftk-all.jar` manually and use the pdftk-simpe API
option `pdftk` to specify the path to your particular JAR file.
